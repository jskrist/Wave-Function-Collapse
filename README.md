# Wave-Function-Collapse

Straight out of quantum mechanics, Wave Function Collapse is an algorithm for procedural generation of images. In this video (recorded over 3 live streams) I attempt the tiled model and explore a variety of solutions to the algorithm in JavaScript with p5.js.

## Plan

### Completed

- [x] Implementation of Tile Model (see: https://youtu.be/rI_y2GAlQFM)
- [x] Implement auto-edge categorization of tiles.
- [x] Filter out redundant tiles

### Next Steps and Refactoring

- [ ] Recursive entropy reduction
- [ ] Shannon entropy

### Future work

- [ ] Overlapping model
